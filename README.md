  The grocery tracking program could be used to track fluctuating prices of various food items and keep a budget which is useful to every day life. One of the challenges of the program was to keep it short and understandable in order for someone else to possibly improve on my code. I feel like I did a pretty decent job at keeping it concise. Although it was challenging, it allowed me to practice keeping my code easily readable and able to be manipulated by others which is a skill that is transferrable between almost any programming language out there. 
  In my dragon text game python program, the main challenge was thinking about the program in both 3D and 2D. I had to program it to loop, but also to end any moment the player decided to end the game. The other challenge was to design the program so that others could create different maze games with my code and even add or remove rooms. This was an exceptionally fun program to design and taught me to think about programming in a different way.
